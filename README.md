## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Client Message

I hope this message finds you well. As we progress with the front-end development of our project, I would like to provide a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to align our development goals. Your expertise in these areas is crucial for the seamless integration and functionality of our platform. Below is the list of tasks, structured for clarity and efficiency:

Graph Design and Functionality Enhancement

Ensure the graph's appearance is consistent with the provided Figma design.
Implement interactive highlighting for options within the graph. Upon selection, relevant data pertaining to the chosen option should be displayed.
Interactive Video Placement for Top NFTs

Develop a feature that allows users to drag and position videos, representing their placement in the 'Top NFTs' section.
Creation of Profile Information Page

Design and develop a Profile Information Page from the ground up, ensuring it meets our specified requirements and design standards.
Pop-Up Messaging Feature

Implement a pop-up feature to facilitate user-to-user messaging within the platform.
Sidebar Integration

Develop and integrate a functional sidebar in line with our platform's design and usability guidelines.
Addition of 'Remove' Button

Incorporate a 'Remove' button, allowing users to delete selections or inputs as needed.
'Save Changes' Functionality

Implement a 'Save Changes' feature, enabling users to securely save their modifications.
'Publish' Button Integration

Add a 'Publish' button, allowing users to finalize and publish their content on the platform.
Unique Display Rule for Top NFTs

Ensure the Top NFTs section does not display duplicate videos. Implement checks to maintain the uniqueness of each featured NFT video.
Restrictions for Top NFTs

Modify the Top NFTs section to exclusively feature videos/NFTs that are available for sale.
Please consider these tasks as a roadmap for our ongoing project. Your input and suggestions are always valued, and I look forward to your feedback on these implementation strategies. Feel free to reach out if you need any further clarification or resources.
